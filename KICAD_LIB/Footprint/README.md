# CCB KiCad Footprint Libraries

## Intended Audience

- Yang Center engineering team

## Brief

- KiCad footprint library

## Standards

- As much as possible, follow the [KiCad Library Conventions](https://klc.kicad.org/)
- Deviations are permitted when it makes sense for our workflow
- Prepend new `.pretty` directories with `ccb_[library name]`
- Add new footprints as you need them for projects
    - When adding a new footprint, also add a matching symbol to the CCB symbol lib if one does not already exist

## Installation/setup

- Clone or download this repo to your local computer
- Add the library to KiCad either globally, or project specific depending on your preference
    - Adding globally probably makes more sense if you will be doing much KiCad work
    - Ideally, all footprints in your projects will come from this library 
- If you are not familiar with KiCad library management, consult the [KiCad documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/7.0/en/pcbnew/pcbnew.html#footprints_and_footprint_libraries)
